objects should be in front of / behind one another depending on their Y value


for every 1 point of Y, units should move by 0.1 on Z
(rounding instead of a smooth linear - you wouldnt want someones face to be on top of someone elses body)


entities should not be vider than +-0.05 Z
base 0, other layers +-0.01 0.02 0.03...
