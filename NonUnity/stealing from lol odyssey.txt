cold mustache - flash from lol odyssey

actually you can take a lot of things from odyssey - the swarms and long range spammers for regular fights and special abilities for boss's attacks


regular enemies:
tanky
invisible unless close
invisible for a few seconds, then visible for a few seconds
 both visible if hit (red flash) and have some shimmer when invisible - careful players still see them
long range spammers
turret mode kogmaws
pullers
tanks creating dmg aura
wall spawners
