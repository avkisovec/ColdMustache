game object tag - bullet

bullet script - .team

if you collide w bullet from other team, you take damage

trail effect - assign script fxBulletTrail that spawns it every update

explosion - assign script fxBulletExplosion through some script manager and call it's spawn() on destroy
.
or bullet class has a var "effect to play on destroy"
.
or explosion can be empty object prefab w script

or have effectsDb script, every effect is a method w parameters where it should spawn
.
this would have frame rate manager integrated to ensure frame rate independence (different life int based on current framerate)
