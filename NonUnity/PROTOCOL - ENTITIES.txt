COLD MUSTACHE - ENTITIES PROTOCOL



CONTAINER
	the actual entity
	requires:
	- rigidbody2D (gravity scale 0, dynamic, freeze rotation)
	- circle / capsule / polygon collider 2d
	- Entity script
	- Sprite manager script (or its children)
	optional:
	- deathAnimation children
	- some behavior script (otherwise wont do much)

	spriteManager requires some SpriteRenderer, can be assigned to container itself (not recommended) or part of some child gameobject
