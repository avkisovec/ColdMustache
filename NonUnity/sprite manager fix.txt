every sprite manager could have sprite[] head, body instead of just a single sprite head, body

on start, it chooses one each sprite randomly, and saves it into special variable and dumps the rest to save on memory


even robots could have multiple sprites for everything

base body could be different metal, based on their age - new & clean (light gray steel), slightly used (darker steel), old (rust, smudges, dark burnt spots), patched (repeared with different metals put together)
paintjob - some patterns (number, one or two sprites, checker pattern, camo), with random colors each
